## Team Member Links

We would very much appreciate if you accumulate updates from all members of your team and submit one pull request for weblinks for all the names. Similar to the example by Bristol, you can:
1. enter a link for your university
University of Bristol, UK

              <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/"
                ><i class="fas fa-link"></i
              ></a>
          
2. enter a link for each researcher - you can use a weblink, LinkedIn, or other social media. I have put 3 examples here, but it would be great if you put a max of 2 per name.
