# Intro

Let's first walk through downloading the core dataset and what options are available.

## Signing The License

Obtaining the dataset or any annotations requires you first sign a license.  Go here to sign the license, and you will be emailed a set of AWS credentials when your signature is approved, which will take ~ 48 hrs.  (In the meantime, you can check out sample notebooks here.)

## Download The CLI

Download the CLI from **[Ego4d CLI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Ego4d/blob/main/ego4d/cli/README.md)**

## Download the annotations and relevant videos

You likely won't want the full dataset!
